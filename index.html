   <h1> How SNAP cuts will impact New Yorkers</h1>
   <h3>New York State receives 8.2% of the $7.8 billion in total SNAP benefits. Potential SNAP cuts can impact the 2.9 million who rely on food assistance.</h3>

    <p>Earlier this month, the longest-running government shutdown in American history ended after President Trump signed a bill passed by Congress. The shutdown threatened essential federal programs including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and paused paychecks for around 1.4 million federal employees.</p>

    <p>Around 2.9 million New Yorkers receive food stamps as of August 2025, roughly 7.1% of all SNAP recipients, and around .86% of the total American population. 61% of New Yorkers on SNAP are children, elderly, and non-elderly disabled, according to a report from the New York Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance.</p>

  <iframe title="New York State SNAP Data (as of May 2025)" aria-label="Pie Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-DR8zu" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/DR8zu/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="427" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}});</script>

    <p>The average amount of benefits per person in New York is among the highest in the nation: around $219, compared to the national average of $188. In New York City, the average is higher, at $235.</p>

    <p>Despite the government reopening, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that passed earlier this year aims to reduce SNAP funding by $186 billion (around 20%) over 10 years. Under the OBBBA, SNAP costs will shift to states, leaving state-level governments to cover 75% of administrative SNAP costs in fiscal year 2027. Shifting costs could likely lead to states to cut SNAP participation, leaving millions of Americans without a reliable source of food assistance.</p> 

    <p>“These unprecedented cuts, which are now one step closer to becoming law, would take food away from children, seniors, and working New Yorkers at a time when visits to New York City soup kitchens and food pantries are already at a record high,” said Jilly Stephens, CEO of non-profit City Harvest, in a July statement responding to the House vote.</p>

    <p>The bill also changes the SNAP work requirements, or time limits. Currently, able-bodied adults between the ages of 18 and 54 must meet the work requirements for more than three months in a three-year period in order to continue receiving SNAP benefits. If they don’t meet those requirements, they are unable to receive benefits until the end of the three years. Under the OBBBA, recipients with exemptions are now subject to the work requirements, including veterans, former foster care dependents, and those experiencing homelessness.</p>
